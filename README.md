# comfyRater

### About
comfyRater is an application that allows you to take a picture of a chair, feed it through a processing algorithm, and it will return how comfy the chair is! This is a fun project meant for me to work on my skills using REST APIs as well as AJAX, Google Vision and Node.JS. 
### Technology
* Node.JS for the backend
* Google Cloud Vision API

### Next Steps

I hope to convert this into a mobile application soon!
